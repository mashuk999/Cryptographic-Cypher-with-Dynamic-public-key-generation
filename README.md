# Cryptographic-Cypher-with-Dynamic-public-key-generation
Demonstration to generate Dynamic public key with added noise to create cypher text

Public key will be dynamic and not two consecutive keys will be same.

The method can be used to generate ultra secure cypher text.

To change the behaviour of cypher you need to change the functions.
